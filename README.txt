SUMMARY
-------

* My solution is perhaps a little over engineered by using a class for the robot, but I wanted to do this to demonstrate a bit more of my skills.
* I have written the code first before the test cases, which made some of the test cases a little "awkward" because much of my validation is done in the construct
	of the robot class.
* I have used "echo" for errors instead of logging them in the error log as I assumed this could be used in a command line.
* I have hardcoded the instructions file in the code rather than using a parameter or ini file just out of convenience, but I could have done either. I recognise that hard
	coding variables like these is "bad practice" but assumed this was not the sort of detail you were looking for.
* I have allowed all instruction to be of any "case" (upper or lower) by converting to lower case.
* I must admit that I have not "tested" my test cases, however I have tested the code itself.
